# Buttons with emotional state

### 1. Anxious

    Subtle shake on hover. Tooltip appears even though no one asked.

### 2. Passive-aggressive

    Looks normal. Click works. Copy reads “Sure. If you want.”

### 3. Emotionally unavailable

    Disabled. No explanation. cursor change to the "Not Allowed" circle-slash before user hovers the button (larger hitbox). When you are over it, the cursor is a normal pointer, but the button moves. Total mixed signals.

### 4. Overly-eager

    Normal size button, large hitbox, grows or bounces excitedly when cursor approaches

### 5. People-pleasing

    Too many confirmations. user must press the button multiple times cycling through “Are you sure?” “Really sure?” “It’s okay if not.” etc

### 6. dissociating

    Animation takes 3-5 seconds to "finish" after clicked, label fade to 10% opacity during the wait, as if it's staring out a window. sometimes forgets what it was supposed to do

### 7. Gaslighting

    The user clicks "Save," but the button changes its label to "Delete" for 0.5 seconds, then back to "Save." When the user gets confused, a tooltip appears saying, "I never said that."

### 8. Overthinking

    Hover immediately shows loading spinner with cycling tooltips: "Considering all possibilities..." → "But what if..." → "Have I thought of everything?"
    Click works instantly and normally despite all the worrying.

### 9. Imposter Syndrome

    Primary button styling, but the label reads:
    “Probably Save?”
    On click, a tooltip appears:
    “Sorry if that was wrong.”

### 10. Identity Crisis

    On hover, the button slowly morphs through UI eras:
    • Skeuomorphic, bevel, inner shadow, glossy highlight
    • Flat, no depth, bold color block
    • Material, soft shadow and ripple
    • Glassmorphism, blur and translucency
    • Brutalist, harsh black border, system font
    • Web 2.0, loud gradient and rounded corners
    The morph takes about 1.2 seconds and loops while hovered.
    On mouse leave, it snaps back to the default design like nothing happened.
    Click works normally throughout.
